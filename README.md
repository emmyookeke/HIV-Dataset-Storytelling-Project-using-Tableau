# HIV Storytelling Project Using Tableau
# Overview
The HIV Storytelling Project aims to provide insights into the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in various regions, identify trends over time, and compare infection rates between countries. By visualizing the data in Tableau, users can gain a deeper understanding of the global impact of HIV/AIDS and identify areas where intervention and prevention efforts may be needed.

# Tableau Workbook
The Tableau workbook included in this project contains interactive dashboards and visualizations that allow users to explore the data in an intuitive and insightful manner. Key features of the Tableau workbook include:

# Interactive maps showing HIV infection rates by country.
Time series charts illustrating trends in infection rates over time.
Comparative analyses highlighting differences in infection rates between countries and regions.
Filter options for users to customize their exploration based on specific criteria such as year, region, or demographic factors.

# Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from reputable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO), UNAIDS, and national health organizations.
